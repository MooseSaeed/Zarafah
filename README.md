## About Zarafah

Zarafah is a web application for a start-up that presents all products in a cool and efficient way. Logo wasn't made by me so you'll have to excuse its quality. :

-   Simple and soft design for front page: Used HTML, Vanilla CSS, Tailwind Css and JavaScript to come up with a smooth design and great functionalities.

-   Simple, fast routing engine: This is a Laravel project, so i've used Laravel 8 routing engine. Also routes are clean since i've used controllers for all routes.
